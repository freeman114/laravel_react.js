        SCALE CAMPAIGN HAS TAKEN COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS TO SAFEGUARD PERSONAL INFORMATION,

        believe

    <p>In developing our business, we may engage in the sale or transfer of certain assets and the
        company
        itself, or parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise assigned. In such transactions and
        changes in
        ownership, user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may constitute one of
        the
        transferred assets. If required by law, we will notify affected users of such transfer or
        assignment in
        accordance with the procedure for changing this Privacy Policy described below.</p>
    <p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy as necessary to protect our users and to
        accommodate a

        make
        material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will make efforts to prominently post such changes
        prior to
        implementing the change. We will not make any retroactive material changes in how we handle
        previously
        collected Personal Information unless you allow us to do so, or unless we are legally required
        to do so,
        and in such a case we will make efforts to inform registered visitors of information on material
        changes
        to this Privacy Policy via email.</p>
